Hi!

This project is rendered using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) which is basically an extended
R Markdown that supports other languages and better reporting tools.

The source code file is `main.qmd` in the root directory. To check the report, please
clone the whole repository and open `Report/main.html` in a browser. Please ensure
data files exist in `Data` folder, so the code chunks run successfully.

To run the code without installing Quarto, simply run `main.rmd` code which has the exact
same code chunks.
